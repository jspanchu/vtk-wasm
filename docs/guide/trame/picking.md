## Hight level explanation

1. Create a vtkPicker and register it so it can be created on the WASM side.
2. Attach a listener on the interactor so you can capture on the server side the picking location (x,y).
3. Call "Pick" on the picker on the WASM side.
4. If something was found, lookup the actor by making another call and convert the result into an actual vtkObject on the server side.
5. Apply some change on the scene and push the update view to the client.
